{"description":"Introducing technologies that are being used to create this blog & difficulties I faced during the process.","id":2,"title":"How this blog was created","date":"5 April 2023","content":"# Hello World\n\nIn this article, I'll be sharing my experiences on the creation of this blog, as well as cool frameworks and libraries that are being used to build this up.\n\n> ### Links\n> - [Source code of the blog](https://github.com/leecheeyong/blog)\n> - [Source of content](https://github.com/frontendkey/frontendkey.github.io)\n> - [Link to blog](https://blog.joelee.works)\n\nCool, let's get started ! \n\nFirst, I would like to introduce the framework I'm using --- [Vue](https://vuejs.org).\nThis was my first ever former project made using Vue and the goal is to get familiar with this framework.\nNot sure why I picked this over other JavaScript framework for building such application, for instance [React](https://react.dev), but I assume that it was because its easier to understand and learn with my current programming skills.\n\nIt was kind of weird that I have been learning the older version of Vue2 (as well as using it at the beginning), and Vue3 was there the whole time. To me, Vue2 was difficult to use and read but I quickly switched to Vue3 after knowing its existance. \n\n> ### Performance \nHonestly, this was my first time using such framework and back then I used to [ejs](https://npmjs.com/ejs) and thought that Javascript framework was bad and would slow down the performance. Turns out this is not certainly true, I was able to get similar performance score on [Pagespeed Insight](https://pagespeed.web.dev) and it shocked me. Well obviously older devices/browser may struggle to execute vast amount of Javascript, but I don't think this should be concerned, anyways I still do prefer to only use CSS for animation if possible and strip as much Javascript code as possible, maximize performance maybe !?\n"}
