# Hello World

In this article, I'll be sharing my experiences on the creation of this blog, as well as cool frameworks and libraries that are being used to build this up.

Cool, let's get started ! 

First, I would like to introduce the framework I'm using --- [Vue](https://vuejs.org).
This was my first ever former project made using Vue and the goal is to get familiar with this framework.
Not sure why I picked this over other JavaScript framework for building such application, for instance [React](https://react.dev), but I assume that it was because its easier to understand and learn with my current programming skills.

It was kind of weird that I have been learning the older version of Vue2 (as well as using it at the beginning), and Vue3 was there the whole time. To me, Vue2 was difficult to use and read but I quickly switched to Vue3 after knowing its existance. 

> ### Performance 
> Honestly, this was my first time using such framework and back then I used to do everything with [ejs](https://npmjs.com/ejs), little amount of Javascript for the frontend and thought that Javascript framework was bad and would slow down the performance. Turns out this is not certainly true, I was able to get similar performance score on [Pagespeed Insight](https://pagespeed.web.dev) for both Vue App & pure HTML, (few lines of Javascript for some simple tasks) & CSS and it shocked me. Well obviously older devices/browser may struggle to execute vast amount of Javascript, but I don't think this should be concerned, anyways I still do prefer to only use CSS for animation if possible and strip as much Javascript code as possible, maximize performance maybe !?

> ### Dark Mode 
> Dark mode toggle is necessary for an application like this (lots of reading) and I started with [Vue Ref](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core.html) and [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), this was my earliest idea and it was not simple to implement, but I still got mine to work, sorta.

> Since mine was not stable, I scouted the internet and found [@vueuse/core](https://npmjs.com/@vueuse/core), this library implements lots of useful features into a Vue application, this includes the dark mode toggle feature. Heck it was so simple to implement this with just few lines of code !
```js
import { useDark, useToggle } from '@vueuse/core'
const isDark = useDark()
const toggleBg = useToggle(isDark)
```

How about the page design, you might ask. I was lazy this time and decided not to code a custom CSS styling for this project, and I use a CSS framework --- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) instead.
