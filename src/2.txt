In this article, I'll be sharing my experiences on the creation of this blog, as well as cool frameworks and libraries that are being used to build this up.

Cool, let's get started ! 

First, I would like to introduce the framework I'm using --- [Vue](https://vuejs.org).
This was my first ever former project made using Vue and the goal is to get familiar with this framework.
Not sure why I picked this over other JavaScript framework for building such application, for instance [React](https://react.dev), but I assume that it was because its easier to understand and learn with my current programming skills.

It was kind of weird that I have been learning the older version of Vue2 (as well as using it at the beginning), and Vue3 was there the whole time. To me, Vue2 was hard to use and understand but I quickly switched to Vue3 after knowing its existance.
