# Hello World

In this article, I'll be sharing my experiences on the creation of this blog, as well as cool frameworks and libraries that are being used to build this up.

Cool, let's get started ! 

First, I would like to introduce the framework I'm using --- [Vue](https://vuejs.org).<br>
This was my first ever former project made using Vue and the goal is to get familiar with this framework.<br>
Not sure why I picked this over other JavaScript framework for building such application, for instance [React](https://react.dev), but I assume that it was because it was able to understand and learn with my current programming skills.
