## "Amazing service providers"

There are lots of amazing tools and services out there and I've handpicked a few that I use to share with you all. Most of them are either free, or has a free tier/trial, so don't hesitate to check them out.

I'll specifying my use case for services listed below, turst me, they do a really good job on those tasks.

### 1. Github

Trust me, you should go create a Github account if you don't have one, there are too many handful features packed in Github. Let me list a few that I love using.

- **Github Actions** - Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate build, test, and deployment pipeline
- **Codespaces** - An online IDE. Development environment that's hosted in the cloud.
- **Github Copilot** - Coding assistance 
- **Github Pages** - Host static sites on web for free without limitation 

There is also the Github Student Pack for students who has a `.edu` school email. Trust me, its free and provide lots of offers, trials and perks. Claim it now if you're a student !

### 2. Replit

I use Replit mostly for hosting projects that can't be hosted on platforms like Vercel, for instance, a Discord Bot. I do own a VPS, but the specs aren't great and I would use Replit for low priority projects.

Replit is an online development environment just like Github Codespaces, but with some differences. Personally, I do not like to interact with thier code editor, terminal, they're bad in my opinion. But the fact that I can spin up a development environment in a matter of seconds, and other than computing & storage limit, there are no other limits on time usage, bandwith limits and so on. For this, I would give Replit a solid 8 out of 10.
